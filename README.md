Project Euler solutions
===
These are my solutions to various problems from https://projecteuler.net/.

**Warning**: _the files in this repository contain complete solutions, which might spoil the fun of solving them yourself._

Most problems are written in C#, and share the common `EulerDotNet` library. This library contains tools for number theory, combinatorics, infinite precision integers and parallelization (I'm quite proud of the latter). 
Nowadays I mostly work in Python 3, and the `EulerDotNet` library is no longer maintained.
